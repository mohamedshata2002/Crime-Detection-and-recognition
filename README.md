## üßêAbout 
This graduation project focuses on crime detection and recognition through video analysis,
even in low light. It involves identifying actions, recognizing license plates, and detecting
known individuals. I was responsible for video classification, enhancing footage quality,
and weapon detection using deep learning algorithms like YOLO and hugging face
algorithms for transfer learning and tools such as OpenCV and Matplotlib
